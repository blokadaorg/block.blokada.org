      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Apr 3, 2018
      </span>
      
      <p>During the last year we&rsquo;ve translated Blokada to 15+ languages, with more than 30 languages in total being worked on. This is amazing!</p>

<p>In order to make the job easier for translators, I decided to change the translation platform to Crowdin. Migrating existing translations took me many hours, and not everything went smoothly to say the least, but I think you will agree it was worth it - the new platform is much better!</p>

<p><a href="/post/2017/06/14/translating-blokada/">You can read more about the new translation platform here</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve contributed translations to Blokada before, I sent you an email about the new system. I invite you to try it out and let me know what you think. Also, we&rsquo;re looking for people interested in managing translations - each language will have a person approving changes having a say on what goes into the app, and what doesn&rsquo;t. We hope to increase the overall quality of translations this way. If you&rsquo;re interested, please read about <a href="/post/2018/03/20/blokada-insiders/">Blokada Insiders</a>.</p>

      <p>Since users seem to confuse the name <em>Blokada</em> very often, I decided to check what the community really thinks about the branding. Over the last 3 weeks we&rsquo;ve been voting on alternative names for the project, and we got some cool suggestions. Here are the results.</p>

<p>The first voting was designed to test if we want to change the name at all. Surprisingly, <strong>89% of users (from 1286 votes) is happy with the name <em>Blokada</em></strong>, or at least think we should not change it.</p>

<p><img src="/img/branding_1.png" alt="Branding vote 1" /></p>

<p>This was a bit of surprise to me, but since rebranding is a significant amount of work and I would prefer not to do it, I was happy with the results ;).</p>

<p>Users who voted to change the name was asked then to vote on one of the existing alternative suggestions, or propose their own. We got some really interesting suggestions, so just to exhaust the topic of branding I decided to run one more survey. The second survey was just focusing on those suggestions, to see which one of them is the best, in case we decide to rebrand after all in the future.</p>

<p><img src="/img/branding_2.png" alt="Branding vote 2" /></p>

<p>We got 358 votes (this survey was running only a few days). The highest number of voters (23%) voted on <em>Blockade</em>. Two next most popular choices were <em>Blocky McBlockface</em> and <em>BlockIt</em>, both with roughly 11% of votes.</p>

<p>So, thank you for so active participation in the first general voting of our community. I am very happy with the engagement and I think this is a very good way to decide about any matters important for the future of the project. In fact, we&rsquo;ll be voting on introducing VPN functionality next.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Mar 2, 2018
      </span>
      
      <p>Blokada v3 is now released and I&rsquo;m gradually rolling out the update to all users. If you haven&rsquo;t received it yet, stay tuned, or just go the <a href="https://blokada.org/#download">download section</a>.</p>

<p>This release is introducing a lot of changes and improvements, and you&rsquo;ll see all of them described in detail in next several posts. Meanwhile, here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved &ldquo;Keep Alive&rdquo; feature. This is addressing the problem of Blokada being killed by the OS too often on some devices.</li>
<li>Improved &ldquo;Start of Boot&rdquo; feature. Now Blokada starts earlier in boot and is more dependable.</li>
<li>Introduced HTTPS to Blokada API and website to improve security and prevent MITM attacks.</li>
<li>Introduced <a href="http://go.blokada.org/chat">Blokada Chat</a>. You are welcome to join us on Telegram!</li>
<li>Introduced <a href="http://go.blokada.org/patron">Blokada Patron</a>. This feature aims to help supporting the project and at the same time reward contributions and active members of the community.</li>
<li>Introduce &ldquo;Chip In&rdquo;, a periodic Call to Action mechanism to engage the userbase and help make community decisions. As a first order of business, the Blokada community is having a vote to express their opinion on Blokada branding.</li>
<li>Simplified and refreshed UI to eliminate confusing bits, keep the codebase nimble and decrease apk size.</li>
<li>Simplified translating Blokada by decreasing the overall amount of strings, eliminating use of plural strings and keeping the core phrases set small.</li>
<li>Fixed several significant bugs, for example with the whitelist.</li>
</ul>

<p>A detailed changelog is always available at <a href="http://go.blokada.org/changelog">go.blokada.org/changelog</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to the great team of Blokada translators, <strong>Blokada v3 is translated to 15 languages from the start.</strong> I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how awesome it is, especially because it was done on a really short notice.</p>

<p><em>Please note that some non-essential bits are still to be translated and you&rsquo;ll see more complete translations in coming days.</em></p>

      <p>The awesome members of the Blokada community just contributed new translations! As of v2.2, Blokada adblocker is now available in two more languages: Italian and Malay. A thank you goes to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Italian: <strong>htrex</strong></li>
<li>Malay: <strong>Syed</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This makes Blokada ad blocker speak 10 languages in total! Just a month after I&rsquo;ve introduced translations support. What&rsquo;s more, Hebrew and Persian are already in the pipeline (I need some more testing for those since they&rsquo;re first RTL languages to be supported by Blokada). This is seriously impressive.</p>

<p>Great job everyone!</p>

      </span>
      
      <p>Blokada 2.2 added a very useful quick actions menu to help you efficiently manage your whitelist. You can easily whitelist and un-whitelist all installed or system apps with one tap. You can also restore your filters to default configuration in case you messed it up too much. Note that it also resets the blacklist.</p>

<p>Here is a video that demonstrates the quick actions menu available in the Whitelist section.</p>

<div class="yt-container"><iframe class="yt-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4YEEpDprcA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Keep in mind a few things while using this feature in it&rsquo;s early release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not every app will immediately act properly after being whitelisted. In some rare cases you may need to kill and restart that app.</li>
<li>App whitelisting is only supported by the optimised blocking mechanism (at least in 2.1). If you are using standard blocking, you&rsquo;ll see a message telling you app whitelisting is ignored.</li>
<li>Your comments on already existing items will disappear if you re-add them using quick actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

      <span class="post-date">Aug 17, 2017
      </span>
      
      <p>Blokada 2.1 introduced a long-awaited app whitelisting feature. This is very useful for dealing with apps that do not work correctly with ad blocking. Some apps, like Google Play Store or GMail are whitelisted out of the box. As always, you have full control how Blokada ad blocker works, so you can easily add and delete whitelisted apps.</p>

<p>Here is a video that demonstrates app whitelisting with XDA Labs app, which used to have problems with downloading apps if Blokada was on. Not anymore!</p>

<div class="yt-container"><iframe class="yt-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIKsSWTxAow?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>To add an app, go to the whitelist section, tap the add button, and simply start typing either app&rsquo;s name or package name (application ID). Blokada will show you suggestions as you type. Once you select and confirm the app, it&rsquo;ll show up in the whitelist. Blokada will also reactivate itself since it&rsquo;s required for the changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Keep in mind a few things while using this feature in it&rsquo;s early release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not every app will immediately act properly after being whitelisted. In some rare cases you may need to kill and restart that app.</li>
<li>App whitelisting is only supported by the optimised blocking mechanism (at least in 2.1). If you are using standard blocking, you&rsquo;ll see a message telling you app whitelisting is ignored.</li>
<li>Some apps will be whitelisted by default if you just installed Blokada. In case you&rsquo;re updating from earlier version, they may not show up, in order to not mess with your custom filters you may have added. Simply add any apps you want to whitelist as you go. Alternatively, if you really want to have the &ldquo;factory&rdquo; filters configuration, simply delete all of them (both from the whitelist and the blacklist), then restart Blokada. The defaults will show up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

      <span class="post-date">Aug 7, 2017
      </span>
      
      <p>Two weeks after Blokada v2.0 was released, and 4 iterations later, the new and shiny Blokada v2.0.4 is the most stable release to date!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be pushing updates to existing users incrementally over the coming days. You&rsquo;ll receive a notification as usual. If you don&rsquo;t want to wait, just use the download links on the website. Just remember to download proper version (if you have Android 4, use the secondary link).</p>

<p>The 2.0.4 update is a maintenance release, so there&rsquo;s not much to brag about feature wise, but I&rsquo;m proud of how stable it is for me so far. I hope your experience is going to be the same! Please report back if you get any problems.</p>

<p>A quick summary of changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rework app connectivity / boot / startup behavior for significantly higher reliability</li>
<li>Introduce &ldquo;Online only&rdquo; switch to let users control Blokada behavior on connectivity changes</li>
<li>Add Malay translations (and improve Dutch and German integration)</li>
<li>Minor bugfixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jul 31, 2017
      </span>
      
      <p>It&rsquo;s been a week since Blokada ad blocker is open sourced and available for free. Here is a short summary of the improvements introduced between versions 2.0 and 2.0.2.</p>

<p>I got great feedback from the XDA folks as usual, and I&rsquo;ve been addressing reported problems as they come. The biggest issue was the stability around imminent network connectivity changes. Apparently, connectivity state events sent by the OS cannot always be trusted, so I introduced some mechanisms (including a watchdog) to make Blokada more aware of the actual state, while not killing the battery. I fixed a bunch of bugs on the way too, so v2.0.2 should really be more snappy.</p>

<p>There was also a problem with dropping filters (hosts count 0), and in result, not blocking any ads, which I also addressed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we&rsquo;ve got full German and Dutch translations, so I&rsquo;m releasing them as well :).</p>

<p>so, after we let the new version sink in and confirm it&rsquo;s stable, the long-awaited app whitelisting feature is next on the todo list :)</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
